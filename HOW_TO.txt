E++ HOW TO GUIDE
================

This file is a practical "how to use everything" guide for this project.
Project root expected:
  c:\Users\rdskn\Downloads\desins\Code


1) QUICK START COMMANDS
-----------------------

Install from GitHub:
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  python -m pip install git+https://github.com/liam13141/epp.git

Run with installed command:
  epp examples/hello.epp
  epp
  epp --check examples/pixel_dodge.epp

Run an E++ script:
  python epp_runner.py examples/hello.epp

Start interactive REPL:
  python epp_runner.py

Check script syntax only (no execution):
  python epp_runner.py --check examples/pixel_dodge.epp

Set custom loop safety limit:
  python epp_runner.py --max-loop-iterations 200000 examples/number_quest.epp

Show language version:
  python epp_runner.py --version

Run test suite:
  python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v

One-command installer scripts (from project root):
  PowerShell: .\install\install_epp.ps1
  Linux/macOS: sh ./install/install_epp.sh


2) REPL HOW TO
--------------

Start REPL:
  python epp_runner.py

Exit REPL:
  exit
  quit

REPL commands:
  :help
  :vars
  :reset
  :load examples/hello.epp

Notes:
  - You can type multi-line blocks in REPL.
  - REPL waits until block is closed (end if/end repeat/end define/end for).


3) CORE E++ SYNTAX
------------------

Variables:
  set x to 10
  let y be 20
  put x + y into total
  set name to "Alice"

Output:
  say "Hello"
  print "Hello"
  show "Hello"
  say x

Input:
  ask "What is your name? " and store in name
  ask "What is your name? " and save as name

Math:
  add 5 to x
  increase x by 5
  subtract 3 from x
  decrease x by 3
  multiply x by 2
  divide x by 4

Conditionals:
  if x is greater than 10 then
    say "big"
  otherwise if x is at least 5 then
    say "medium"
  otherwise
    say "small"
  end if

  when x is greater than 10 then
    print "big"
  else
    print "small"
  finish if

Loops:
  repeat 5 times
    say "loop"
  end repeat

  do 5 times
    print "loop"
  finish repeat

  repeat while x is less than 10
    add 1 to x
  end repeat

  while x is less than 10 do
    increase x by 1
  finish repeat

  for each item in mylist
    say item
  end for

  for every item in mylist
    print item
  finish for

Loop control:
  stop repeat
  skip repeat
  break loop
  next loop
  stop for
  skip for

Functions:
  define add_two with a and b
    return a + b
  end define

  function add_two with a and b
    give back a + b
  finish function
  # you can also close with: end function

  call add_two with 2, 3
  run add_two with 2, 3
  set result to call add_two with 2, 3
  set result2 to run add_two with 2, 3

Lists:
  create list nums
  make list nums2
  add 5 to nums
  remove 5 from nums
  take 5 from nums

Comments:
  # this is a comment

Boolean and null-like values:
  true
  false
  nothing


4) CONDITIONS YOU CAN WRITE
---------------------------

Supported plain-English condition forms:
  a is greater than b
  a is greater than or equal to b
  a is less than b
  a is less than or equal to b
  a is bigger than b
  a is smaller than b
  a is at least b
  a is at most b
  a equals b
  a is equal to b
  a is not b
  a is not equal to b
  a contains b
  a does not contain b

You can also use expression-style conditions:
  if x > 5 and y < 10 then


5) BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS
---------------------

General:
  len, str, int, float, bool, range, list
  abs, min, max, sum, round, sorted
  random()
  random(min, max)
  random_int(min, max)
  random_float(min, max)
  choice(items)
  sleep(seconds)

Example:
  set n to call random with 1, 10
  say n

Plain-English random expressions:
  set roll to random between 1 and 6
  set noise to random
  set pick to random choice from items


6) WINDOW + PIXEL GAME FUNCTIONS
--------------------------------

These open a real desktop window (tkinter).

Functions:
  open_window(width, height, title, pixel_size, background)
  close_window()
  window_is_open() / window_open()
  poll_window()
  present()
  clear_screen(color)
  draw_pixel(x, y, color)
  draw_rect(x, y, w, h, color)
  draw_text(x, y, text, color, size)
  key_down(key_name)
  key_pressed(key_name)
  set_window_title(title)

Minimal game loop:
  call open_window with 64, 48, "My Game", 10, "black"
  set running to true
  repeat while running
    call poll_window
    set open_now to call window_is_open
    if open_now == false then
      set running to false
    otherwise
      call clear_screen with "black"
      call draw_rect with 10, 10, 3, 3, "lime"
      call present
      call sleep with 0.03
    end if
  end repeat

Common keys:
  left right up down
  a d w s
  space return escape

Run included pixel game:
  python epp_runner.py examples/pixel_dodge.epp

Built-in Flask-like web functions (no external dependencies):
  flask_app(name)
  flask_get(app, path, handler_or_text)
  flask_post(app, path, handler_or_text)
  flask_run(app, host, port)
  flask_test_request(app, method, path, body)
  flask_html(html, status)
  flask_fetch(url, method, body, headers, timeout)
  flask_fetch_json(url, method, body, headers, timeout)

Beginner-friendly web aliases:
  create_web_app(name)
  when_someone_visits(app, path, handler_or_text)
  when_someone_posts(app, path, handler_or_text)
  start_web_server(app, host, port)
  test_web_request(app, method, path, body)
  make_html_page(html, status)
  fetch_from_api(url)
  fetch_json_from_api(url)

Minimal web app:
  set app to call create_web_app with "E++ Site"
  call when_someone_visits with app, "/", call make_html_page with "<h1>Hello from E++</h1>"
  say "Open http://127.0.0.1:5000"
  call start_web_server with app, "127.0.0.1", 5000

Plain-English statement forms:
  create a website called "Easy Site" and store in app
  when someone visits "/" on app show html page "<h1>Welcome</h1>"
  when someone posts "/submit" on app show "Saved"
  start web server for app on "127.0.0.1" port 5000
  fetch from "https://example.com" and store in page_text
  fetch json from "https://api.example.com/data" and store in data

Startup log:
  successful http://127.0.0.1:5000

Request logs:
  request GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/ -> 200
  request POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/submit -> 200

Stop the server:
  Ctrl+C


7) INCLUDED EXAMPLES
--------------------

Run each with:
  python epp_runner.py <file>

Files:
  examples/hello.epp
  examples/counter.epp
  examples/functions_and_lists.epp
  examples/advanced_control_flow.epp
  examples/number_quest.epp
  examples/readable_basics.epp
  examples/pixel_dodge.epp
  examples/flask_hello.epp
  examples/test.epp

Syntax-check all examples:
  python epp_runner.py --check examples/hello.epp
  (repeat for each file you care about)


8) BEGINNER WEBSITE (CORCE)
---------------------------

Folder:
  corce/

Open:
  corce/index.html

What it contains:
  - beginner lesson path
  - quiz and checklist
  - E++ <-> Python two-way translator
  - quick cheat sheet


9) VS CODE WORKFLOW
-------------------

Project has .vscode config:
  - Run Current E++ File
  - Run E++ REPL
  - tasks for one-click running

Typical flow:
  1. Open .epp file
  2. Use Run and Debug -> Run Current E++ File
  3. Or terminal command: python epp_runner.py your_file.epp


10) TROUBLESHOOTING
-------------------

If you see:
  Oops! I don't understand ...
Then:
  - check spelling of command keywords
  - make sure block endings exist (end if/end repeat/etc.)

If you see:
  Oops! I can't find 'x' ...
Then:
  - define it first with set x to ...

If windowed game won't open:
  - run on desktop Python (not headless server)
  - ensure tkinter is available in your Python install

If loops run forever:
  - add stop condition
  - or lower/raise --max-loop-iterations as needed


11) MAKE YOUR OWN SCRIPT FAST
-----------------------------

Template:
  set score to 0
  repeat 5 times
    add 1 to score
  end repeat
  say "Score: " + str(score)

Save as:
  examples/my_game.epp

Run:
  python epp_runner.py examples/my_game.epp


12) IMPORTANT NOTE
------------------

E++ expressions are evaluated by Python under the hood.
Do not run untrusted .epp files from unknown sources.
